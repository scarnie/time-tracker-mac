This file contains information for developing and testing Time Tracker.

== Prerequisites == 
* Rubygems
* gem install text-format
* gem install cucumber
* gem install rspec

== Release Packaging ==

1. Make sure the version number is updated:
    1a. Update CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION for "All Configurations" in the Project Info.

2. Update the ChangeLog.yml.

3. Test the code
    3a. Run "rake spec" and verify that there are no errors or failures.
    3b. Run "rake features" and verify that there are no failures or pending steps.

4. Build the Time Tracker.zip release file:
    4a. Run `rake build_release`.  This will create "build/Release/Time Tracker-$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).zip".

5. If Sparkle or the release file configuration has been changed, test the auto-update system:
    5a. Install the previous version of Time Tracker.
    5b. Update and post appcast/timetracker-test.xml
    5c. Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.slooz.timetracker.plist and change
        SUFeedURL to the location of timetracker-test.xml  (If the URL contains
        spaces, replace them with "%20".)
    5d. Ensure that the old version of Time Tracker can update to the new version.
    5e. Ensure that the new version of Time Tracker can update to itself.

6. Run `rake appcast` to generate appcast/timetracker-$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).html
   and update appcast/timetracker-stable.xml

7. Publish the release:
    7a. Run `rake upload`.  You will need to enter your google code username and your googlecode
        password which is found at http://code.google.com/hosting/settings
        This will upload Time Tracker-$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).zip and 
        timetracker-$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).html to
        http://time-tracker-mac.googlecode.com
    7b. Upload timetracker-stable.xml to http://www.avh4.net/appcast/

8. Update the website:
    8a. Update the homepage http://time-tracker-mac.googlecode.com
    8b. Make the new release the featured download http://time-tracker-mac.googlecode.com
    8c. Update iusethis.com
    8d. Update versiontracker.com

9. Tag the release with "v$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)" and push the commit.

== Appcast updates with Sparkle ==

There is a dummy appcast which will alway contain a fake "update" for Time
Tracker.  To use this to test the Sparkle updating, edit Info.plist and change
"SUFeedURL" to point to "timetracker-test.xml" instead of
"timetracker-stable.xml"
